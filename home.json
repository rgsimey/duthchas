        "Community Asset Transfers allow community organisations to acquire publicly-owned land at below-market value for community benefit. Established by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, this gives communities a legal right to request transfer of public assets from bodies like Forestry and Land Scotland.",
        "Forestry and Land Scotland has completed 26 successful transfers since 2016, supporting projects from renewable energy to woodland management. For our project, CATS provides a proven pathway to community ownership, enabling sustainable woodland management that combines conservation with livelihood creation."
