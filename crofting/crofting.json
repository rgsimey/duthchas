        "While woodland crofts are recognised in Scottish policy, precise definitions are still being established. Current guidance states a woodland croft should have \"sufficient tree cover overall to be considered a woodland under UK forestry policy\" but doesn't specify coverage percentages or land use ratios.",
        "This pilot project will help establish practical definitions by working with the Scottish Crofting Federation and partners to determine appropriate tree coverage thresholds, land use mixes, and management approaches.",
        "The proposed feasibility work will contribute evidence to support clearer policy definitions for future woodland croft development across Scotland."

        "<strong>Integrate sustainable forestry with small-scale agriculture</strong> - The pilot project will demonstrate how woodland crofting integrates traditional agroforestry practices with modern sustainable forestry. By replacing sections of commercial Sitka spruce plantation with a diverse mix of productive woodland and small-scale agricultural plots, we can create a more resilient and productive landscape. This approach allows for selective felling, natural regeneration, and the development of forest gardens that provide multiple yields while protecting soil health.",
        "<strong>Create opportunities for new entrants to crofting</strong> - As Arran is designated as a crofting area, this project provides a unique opportunity to establish new woodland crofts. This model makes land access more affordable and creates pathways for diverse people to enter crofting. The project will particularly focus on supporting those who might otherwise face barriers to entering agriculture or forestry, helping to attract and retain working-age people on the island.",
        "<strong>Support local food production and timber enterprises</strong> - The project aims to strengthen Arran's local food and timber economy. By establishing woodland crofts that combine food growing with sustainable timber production, we can support new enterprises in areas such as market gardening, fruit production, and small-scale timber processing. The project includes development of a community larder and opportunities for food preservation, alongside sustainable timber harvesting and processing.",
        "<strong>Enhance biodiversity through diverse land management</strong> - Working alongside NatureScot's objectives, the project will enhance biodiversity through careful restoration of wetland areas and protection of existing native woodland. Moving away from monoculture forestry towards a diverse woodland ecosystem will create varied habitats supporting wildlife. The integration of crofting activities will create a mosaic of different environments, from woodland edges to small clearings, supporting greater species diversity.",
        "<strong>Preserve traditional skills while embracing innovation</strong> - Drawing on Arran's rich heritage of land management, the project will help preserve and pass on vital skills in areas such as food preservation, woodland management, and building techniques. These traditional approaches will be complemented by innovative solutions in areas such as renewable energy, sustainable building design, and water management systems.",
        "<strong>Build community resilience through sustainable land use</strong> - By creating a working demonstration of community-led woodland management, this project will strengthen local resilience. The combination of sustainable forestry, local food production, and traditional skill sharing will help build a more self-reliant community. The project specifically addresses local challenges around flooding and erosion at the Cloyburn, showing how good land management upstream can protect downstream communities."
