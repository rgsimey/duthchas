        "While woodland crofts are recognised in Scottish policy, precise definitions are still being established. Current guidance states a woodland croft should have \"sufficient tree cover overall to be considered a woodland under UK forestry policy\" but doesn't specify coverage percentages or land use ratios.",
        "Woodland crofting projects help establish practical definitions by working with the Scottish Crofting Federation and partners to determine appropriate tree coverage thresholds, land use mixes, and management approaches.",
        "Feasibility work contributes evidence to support clearer policy definitions for future woodland croft development across Scotland."

        "<strong>Integrate sustainable forestry with small-scale agriculture</strong> - Woodland crofting integrates traditional agroforestry practices with modern sustainable forestry. By replacing sections of commercial Sitka spruce plantation with a diverse mix of productive woodland and small-scale agricultural plots, it creates more resilient and productive landscapes. This approach allows for selective felling, natural regeneration, and the development of forest gardens that provide multiple yields while protecting soil health.",
        "<strong>Create opportunities for new entrants to crofting</strong> - In designated crofting areas, woodland crofts provide unique opportunities to establish new holdings. This model makes land access more affordable and creates pathways for diverse people to enter crofting. Projects particularly focus on supporting those who might otherwise face barriers to entering agriculture or forestry, helping to attract and retain working-age people in rural areas.",
        "<strong>Support local food production and timber enterprises</strong> - Woodland crofts strengthen local food and timber economies. By combining food growing with sustainable timber production, they support new enterprises in areas such as market gardening, fruit production, and small-scale timber processing. Projects include development of community larders and opportunities for food preservation, alongside sustainable timber harvesting and processing.",
        "<strong>Enhance biodiversity through diverse land management</strong> - Working alongside conservation objectives, woodland crofting enhances biodiversity through careful restoration of wetland areas and protection of existing native woodland. Moving away from monoculture forestry towards diverse woodland ecosystems creates varied habitats supporting wildlife. The integration of crofting activities creates a mosaic of different environments, from woodland edges to small clearings, supporting greater species diversity.",
        "<strong>Preserve traditional skills while embracing innovation</strong> - Drawing on Scotland's rich heritage of land management, woodland crofting helps preserve and pass on vital skills in areas such as food preservation, woodland management, and building techniques. These traditional approaches are complemented by innovative solutions in areas such as renewable energy, sustainable building design, and water management systems.",
        "<strong>Build community resilience through sustainable land use</strong> - By creating working demonstrations of community-led woodland management, woodland crofting strengthens local resilience. The combination of sustainable forestry, local food production, and traditional skill sharing helps build more self-reliant communities. Projects specifically address local challenges around flooding and erosion, showing how good land management upstream can protect downstream communities."
